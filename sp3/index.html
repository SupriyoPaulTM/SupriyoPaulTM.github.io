            <p>
                Hello! I’m <b>Supriyo Paul</b>, a passionate 
                <b>Maths and Physical Science teacher</b> from 
                <b>Daulatpur, South Dinajpur, West Bengal</b>. 
                I love helping students understand 
                complex concepts in a simple and interesting way. 
                Teaching isn’t just my profession — 
                it’s something that gives me real joy and 
                purpose every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside teaching, 
                I’m also learning <b>Web Development</b>. 
                I’ve built a few static websites using <b>HTML</b> 
                and <b>CSS</b>, including a 
                <b>personal portfolio</b> and a small <b>school website</b>. 
                I enjoy creating clean, simple web pages that are both useful and beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I love exploring new ideas, learning small creative projects with <b>Python</b>, and continuously improving my skills — whether it’s in technology or in teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to grow both as a dedicated educator and a curious learner, building a life around creativity, learning, and helping others grow.
            </p>
